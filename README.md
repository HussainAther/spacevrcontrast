# Space VR for "Contrast and Control"

## Overall goal/project idea: 

Make a VR app that we can use to visualize the differences in scale and size between different parts of the universe. We want to show the contrast between the Earth and Milky Way Galaxy and how those structures form over time. 

Using the 2021.3.17f1 version of Unity.

## Assignments / What to do:
* Start by being able to visualize this: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/need-some-space-d6521362b37b48e3a82bce4911409303 
* * Import it to Unity (for loading the file: https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx) 

* Look for assets of different scales like the Earth, a city, a cell. 

* (@HussainAther) - Look into this script and convert it to C sharp: https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/scale-of-the-universe-vr/blob/main/scale.js
