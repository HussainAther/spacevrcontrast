# Space VR for "Contrast and Control"

## Overall goal/project idea: 

Make a VR app that we can use to visualize the differences in scale and size between different parts of the universe. We want to show the contrast between the Earth and Milky Way Galaxy and how those structures form over time. 

Using the 2021.3.17f1 version of Unity.

## Assignments / What to do:
* Solar system has been visualized in scale and distance with a camera that moves forward and backward trough the solar system.

## Instructions

* Move forward and backward using the Arrow Keys (Z and X for faster movement).
